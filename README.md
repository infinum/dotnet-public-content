## Analyzers

This directory contains configuration files for [Stylecop](https://github.com/DotNetAnalyzers/StyleCopAnalyzers) and [Roslynator](https://github.com/JosefPihrt/Roslynator) analyzers. We use these configurations in all of our projects to help us enforce the rules we described in our [Handbook](https://infinum.com/handbook/dotnet/best-practices/code-style).
